I watch sports on my Windows PC; I want a program that shows a rectangle on the screen that I can use to cover the part of the screen where the scores of other games are shown.  It should not have any Windows menus/title bars/etc; it should just be a plain black rectangle that is always on top of other Windows.  When the mouse is over the rectangle, a border should show in white (to make it visible over a black background).  I should be able to click and drag to move the rectangle.  I should be able to drag any of the four edges to resize; if that's too difficult, it's OK if only the right and bottom edges are draggable.  Double-clicking should close the window.  It should remember its most recent position in a simple settings file, and when it starts up, it should start at the most recent position.  I don't care what language it's written in.
